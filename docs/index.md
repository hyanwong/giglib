# Welcome to *giglib*, the Genetic Inheritance Graph Library

This is the documentation for the
[Genetic Inheritance Graph Library (giglib)](https://github.com/hyanwong/giglib),
which stores inheritance patterns of genetic sequences
that may have undergone genomic restructuring (i.e. it stores
genetic ancestry with structural variation).

The library is a work-in-progress, and is not yet officially released.

Please visit [https://github.com/hyanwong/giglib](https://github.com/hyanwong/giglib) to contribute to development.

The rest of this documentation is organised into the following sections:

```{tableofcontents}
