# Welcome to the Genetic Inheritance Graph Library

This is the documentation for the
[GeneticInheritanceGraphLibrary](https://github.com/hyanwong/GeneticInheritanceGraphLibrary),
which stores inheritance patterns of genetic sequences
that may have undergone genomic restructuring (i.e. it stores
genetic ancestry with structural variation).

The library is a work-in-progress, and is not yet officially released.

The rest of this documentation is organised into the following sections:

```{tableofcontents}
